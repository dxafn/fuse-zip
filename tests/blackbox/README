Test suite for black box testing of fuse-zip.

You need the following programs and libraries:
Tcl >= 8.5
tcllib >= 1.10
BLT
Tclx
zip
diff
valgrind

To run testsuite invoke command
$ ./fuse-zip.test
or
$ ./fuse-zip.test -valgrind
to check memory errors with valgrind.

Additional options can be passed to valgrind using VALGRIND_ARGS environment
variable. For example, you can ask valgrind to generate suppressions (that can
be added to file valgrind.supp) by specifying the following variable value:
VALGRIND_ARGS="--gen-suppressions=all"

To get list of all tests use -list switch.

To run only interected tests instead of full test suite, pass test identifier
patterns (glob-like) to testsuite script.
For example:
$ ./fuse-zip.test 'truncate-*' 'rename-*'
